# Image_Enhancement_TCGA-STAD_Cancer_Images
An image enhancement approach useful for improving the adenocorcinoma edges information with respect to the nonhomogeneous background. The look–up table (LUT) based method [24] for correcting the MSCT image inhomogeneities and for adenocarcinoma enhancement is used. This enhancement method has been used to improve the image information in confocal microcope images [25] and X–ray rotational angiography images[26].
